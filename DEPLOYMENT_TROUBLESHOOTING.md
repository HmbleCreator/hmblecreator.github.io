# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: Website showing README instead of actual site

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue is likely one of these:

1. **GitHub Pages Settings**: The repository settings may not be configured to use GitHub Actions as the deployment source
2. **Missing index.html**: The built files may not include a proper index.html in the root
3. **Branch/Folder Configuration**: The Pages settings might be looking in the wrong location

### Verification Steps

#### 1. Check GitHub Pages Settings
Go to your repository → Settings → Pages and verify:
- **Source**: Should be "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
- **Branch**: Should show "main" with GitHub Actions workflow

#### 2. Verify Build Output
The workflow builds to the `out/` directory with these files:
- `index.html` (main page)
- `404.html` (error page)
- `_next/` (static assets)
- `.nojekyll` (prevents Jekyll processing)
- `CNAME` (custom domain)

#### 3. Test Direct Access
Try accessing:
- https://hmblecreator.github.io/
- https://hmblecreator.github.io/index.html
- https://hmblecreator.github.io/404.html

### Applied Fixes

1. ✅ **Fixed Next.js Configuration**
   - Removed conflicting `assetPrefix: './'`
   - Removed `basePath` for root domain deployment
   - Kept `output: 'export'` for static generation

2. ✅ **Enhanced Deployment Workflow**
   - Added detailed debugging output
   - Added explicit artifact configuration
   - Added file verification steps

3. ✅ **Updated Build Process**
   - Removed redundant export script
   - Simplified build to use `npm run build` only

### Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes** to trigger a new deployment
2. **Check GitHub Pages settings** to ensure GitHub Actions is selected as source
3. **Monitor the Actions tab** for deployment status
4. **Test the website** after deployment completes

### Emergency Fix (if needed)
If the issue persists, you can manually trigger a rebuild by:
1. Going to Actions tab → Deploy workflow
2. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
3. Wait for completion and check results
